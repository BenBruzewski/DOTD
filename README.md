# DOTD
- This repo holds the files for my video game project from ENG101, Disaster on The Diamond. It's a murder mystery game made in Python.
- This project's assets were fully made by me using Piskel. I would highly recommend Piskel to anyone looking to make sprites, spritesheets, or pixel animation!


# How to run DOTD: 

- You need a program to run .py files. Personally, I would recommend IDLE for this project as it's what I have used in testing. 
- You will also need to ensure you have all the supporting assets for the game. Please download the "images" folder alongside your .py file and ensure they're in the same folder. 
- Please keep in mind that if you "win" the game a .txt file will be generated as a scoreboard. This will appear in the same directory as your .py file. 


# Game Explanation: 

Disaster on the Diamond is a murder mystery "point-and-click" style game where the player's job is to pick from a list of suspects and find the murderer. 

The player will read through some background information on the suspects, and then proceed through 5 different rooms to find clues. Each room has 1 clue randomly placed in the room

In order to proceed, the player can hit the continue arrow. The player does not have to acquire each clue before proceeding, but the clues will help them figure out the case correctly.

Once the player has gone through all 5 rooms, they'll get a chance to read the clues again, and then they will click on which suspect they believe is the murderer. 

If the player guesses correctly, they will get the winner screen and be prompted to enter their name for the scoreboard

If the player guesses incorrectly, they will be taken to the loser screen and will not be asked for their name or have their time recorded.
